# 3D-Pong-in-Pygame

https://youtu.be/pO-TjI3w3Yo 

It's Pong but in 3D!

This game was created using Pygame and PyOpenGL.

The 'Red Paddle' is Player 1 controlled by the 'A' and 'D' keys. The 'Blue Paddle' is Player 2 controlled by the 'Left' and 'Right' arrow keys.

The first player to 6 points wins! And you can reset the game by pressing the 'Spacebar' at anytime.

Also if you download or copy the raw '3D_Pong.py' script, make sure you also:

1. Download the '3D Pong.png' (Pygame's Icon Image)
2. Install Python 3.10+
3. Type 'pip install pygame-ce PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate' into your console or IDE's terminal where the file is kept
